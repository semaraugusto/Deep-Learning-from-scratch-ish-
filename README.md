# Deep-Learning-from-scratch-ish-

My solution to the implementation of resnet from scratch(ish) proposed by Jeremy Howard on FastAI course v3 part 2.

## Rules
* Can only use:
    * Python standard library
    * Non data science libraries
    * PyTorch arrays, random number generation and indexing
    * fastai.datasets
    * Matplotlib

* Once something has been developed I can use it freely
* If some algorithm that I already implemented is a lot slower than some torch module or numpy module I can use their implementation if and only if it uses something not available in python like a BLAS.

## Order of implementation:

* matmul.py
* Perceptron.ipynb
